# I Went To a Resort and Got Addicted To Gambling with my Classmates Souls
### Project Description
A mobile gacha dating game set in a resort, where players could romantically pursue classmates who had metamorphosed into demons and eldritch beings. The game aimed to feature mini-games allowing players to earn points for purchasing gifts for their chosen partners. Scaled back to a proof of concept.
